            <h1>Hello! I am Emmett Jenkins</h1>
            <h4>I study programming!</h4>
            I am a smart kid, but oftentimes clumbsy.
            <p>Everytime I work with HTML, I get abnormally tired. It literally makes me sleepy.</p>
            <p>Despite that, I really like programming. In the past I've studied multiple coding languages to learn to program.</p>
            <p>This website was made to showcase a number of things I learned in programming class</p>
            <h3>Here are a few of my interests:</h3>
